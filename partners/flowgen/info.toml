description = "FlowGen is a Swiss-based renewable energy company that leveraged extensive aerodynamic know-how from the automotive racing industry into the wind industry to optimize the design of a 5-meter wind turbine. These turbines can be installed virtually anywhere without the need for high masts or deep foundations. This has a huge impact on costs and makes it possible to deliver power to some of the most remote & poor parts of the world. Together with FlowGen, ThreeFold can push Internet capacity for a fair price to the places that need it the most."
