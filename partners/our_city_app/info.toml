description = "OurCity app is the application that has everything needed to live in a city. It connects users, merchants and governments into one ecosystem. The platform gathers nine city apps, 5,578 Merchants and 61,2542 users (Q3 2019). This application was started from out of the incubator Incubaid which is the source of many of our projects. The app has integration with the ThreeFold Token. Once the TFT is more liquid the plan is to go back to the cities which use the app and see if they are ok promoting this token on a wider scale."
